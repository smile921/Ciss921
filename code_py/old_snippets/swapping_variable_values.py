# Swapping variable values
# Originally from: Learning Python

# Setup the originally variables and their values
one = 1
two = 2

# View the original variables
print('one =', one, 'two =', two)

# Swap the values
one, two = two, one

# View the swapped values, notice how the values for each variable have changed
print('one =', one, 'two =', two)
