# Basic Arithmatic

# Create some simulated variables
x = 6
y = 9

# x plus y
print(x + y)

# x minus y
print(x - y)

# x times y
print(x * y)

# the remainder of x divided by y
print(x % y)

# x divided by y
print(x / y)

# x divided by y (floor) (i.e. the quotient)
print(x // y)

# x raised to the y power
print(x ** y)

# x plus y, then divide by x
print((x + y) / x)

# Classics vs. floor division. This varies between 2.x and 3.x.

# Classic divison of 3 by 5
print(3 / 5)

# Floor divison of 3 by 5. This means it truncates any remainder down the its "floor"
print(3 // 5)
