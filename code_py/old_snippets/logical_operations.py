# Logical Operations

# Create some simulated variables
x = 6
y = 9
z = 12

# x or y
x or y

# x and y
x and y

# not x
not x

# x is equal to y
x == y

# x is not equal to y
x != y

# One is less than two.
print(1 < 2)

# Two is less than or equal to four.
print(2 <= 4)

# Three is equal to five.
print(3 == 5)

# Three is not equal to four.
print(3 != 4)

# x is less than y which is less than z
print(x < y < z)

# x is less than y and y is less than z
print(x < y and y < z)
